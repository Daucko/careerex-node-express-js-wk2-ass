      <h2>Junk Foods</h2>
      <p>
        Junk food refers to highly processed foods that are high in sugar,
        unhealthy fats, and salt but low in essential nutrients. Common examples
        include chips, soda, fast food, and candy. While junk food is convenient
        and tasty, excessive consumption can lead to health issues like obesity,
        diabetes, and heart disease. Maintaining a balanced diet by limiting
        junk food and choosing healthier alternatives is essential for overall
        well-being.
